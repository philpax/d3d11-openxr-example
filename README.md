# d3d11-openxr-example

Like <https://github.com/philpax/wgpu-openxr-example>, but for D3D11, and entirely generated by Claude.

Shows a spinning triangle in front of you, as well as triangles for each of your controllers.

Based on [the Vulkan example from `openxrs`](https://github.com/Ralith/openxrs/blob/master/openxr/examples/vulkan.rs).
